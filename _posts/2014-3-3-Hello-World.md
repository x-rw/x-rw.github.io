Some time ago when i study in university i was programer creating many instance of objects, for example: to BUSCAMINAS game i create explicitly the objects, new Flag(), new Mine(), new Table(), new Casilla(), etc.

Next with the analogy that a box is a bomb or is a flag, then my creations was bad bad bad..., why create explicitly? is better delegate this funcionality to other class, and BOOM BOMM this class is the Factory, the Factory should to take over to create objects.
