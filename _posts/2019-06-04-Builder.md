title: Builder Pattern
---


Sometimes it is necessary to construct objects through a process, since each class must focus on a single task, the construction must be a task of another class that builds objects, it can be said that it is necessary to construct objects with this pattern when the object is composed of several parts.

next I present a Pizza class, and another class Generator


why use a pizza for example? It can also be a car, a plane, a truck since all of them consist of several parts, for example the pizza consists of the dough, tomato, cheese, ham, and other ingredients that other people like a lot.

```java
public class Pizza {

    private int size;
    private double cheese;
    private double pepperoni;
    private double bacon;

    public static class Builder {

        private double cheese;
        private double pepperoni;
        private double bacon;

        public Builder cheese(double cheese) {
            this.cheese = cheese;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder pepperoni(double pepperoni) {
            this.pepperoni = pepperoni;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder bacon(double bacon) {
            this.bacon = bacon;
            return this;
        }

        public Pizza build() {
            System.out.println("" + this);
            return new Pizza(this);
        }
    }

    private Pizza(Builder builder) {
        cheese = builder.cheese;
        pepperoni = builder.pepperoni;
        bacon = builder.bacon;
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        Pizza pizza = new Pizza.Builder().cheese(9.0).bacon(3.2).pepperoni(2.3).build();
        System.out.println("EL pedido es: " + pizza);
    }
}
```
